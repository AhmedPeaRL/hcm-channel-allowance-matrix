# Channel-Allowance Matrix

This repository defines how artifacts are allowed to appear across channels
without promotion, request, optimization, or narrative.

No channel is a target.
No channel is a goal.

Channels are treated as surfaces that may or may not receive an artifact,
based solely on the artifact’s internal state.

Nothing here instructs production.
Nothing here enforces release.
